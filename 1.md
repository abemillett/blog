# Hello World.

Time to pick up some new skills. Let's learn some Computer Science!

I will be following the curriculum suggested at [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/). This curriculum covers nine major areas:

 - Programming
 - Computer Architecture
 - Algorithms and Data Structures
 - Math for CS
 - Operating Systems
 - Computer Networking
 - Databases
 - Languages and Compilers
 - Distributed Systems

This seems all rather heady. I will consider interspersing some Zen readings or similar to stay grounded.

An effective strategy for learning is to imagine teaching a difficult concept to a disinterested party. A little bit like ELI5 - if you can keep their interest and transfer the essential knowledge of the concept then you will have crystallized the concept in your own mind.

And that is the essence of learning - to crystallize new concepts into your personal mental framework. So I will pretend that you the reader are disinterested in CS and will attempt to transfer the essential knowledge of these heady concepts to you. With any luck we will both learn something.
